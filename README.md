Machine Learning on Hero Picks

There are 121 heros in Dota 2 to choose from. This project aims to help players determine which hero they should pick based on the current state of the picks.
We aim to collect thousands of games of Dota, analyze the heros picked on each team, and the winning team in order to help predict the ideal hero pick based on the already picked heros.

## Dataset:

[Opendota](docs.opendota.com)

## Time Plan
 - Session 1: Gather data to model on. Look at predicting picks on partial Data provided (not all 9 heros will have been picked yet)
 - Session 2: Start training and start on UI
 - Session 3: Continue UI + modelling
 - Session 4: Combine UI with model to create a completed web app
 - Session 5: Work on presentation
